Some codes for games.



               Here is an idea for agame that I can programm maybe.
               
               
                 .game name is called maze attack.the concept is to use a person thing or image to be able to have someone move the object or person through the maze.if touching any part of the maze,hen the player would lose.the maze would be like a regular maze except the maze would have obstacles that would move and try to get the player to touch them so that teh player would lose.At the end there should be upgrades for the player.Ideas I have for the upgrades at the end of each maze would be more quick and fast player or some type of fantasy weapon to destroy some of teh obstacles.after each maze (or game) the mazes get more confusing and difficult.There should be a boos battle at the end to make it more fun.A story could also be made in the game,such as a player had been givin a fortune from the mayor,but the evil boss stole it.That could be teh whole point of the game or there could be a whole different point.
